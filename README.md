### About the data

The datasets used in this project were obtained, respectively, from:

- [üèÜGrammy Awards](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/grammy-awards) "Grammy Awards, 1958 - 2019"
- [üéπ Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)  "A dataset of Spotify songs with different genres and their audio features"

### Prerequisites
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è __Warning__ The pipeline was build using a Unix OS, please take this in count ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### Applications :
1. Install Python : [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install PostgreSQL : [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è The data visualization was designed on Windows OS, taking advantage of the database instance in the cloud. ‚ö†Ô∏è 
4. Install Power BI : [Install Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494) 

#### Preparations:
1. Get drive credentials, I recommend going to the [official PyDrive documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/) and you can use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI4XjwbpEwU&t=6s) as a guide.
2. If you want to run the project with a database instance with google cloud platform, use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjzDMjo9Fko) as a guide or you can run the whole project locally!

### ¬øHow to run this project?  

1. Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SamuelEscalante/Workshop-02-ETL.git
```

2. Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd Workshop-2-ETL
```

3. In the root of the project, create a `db_settings.json` file, this to set the database credentials
```json
{
  "DIALECT": "The database dialect or type. In this case, it is set to 'postgres' for PostgreSQL.",
  "PGUSER": "Your PostgreSQL database username.",
  "PGPASSWD": "Your PostgreSQL database password.",
  "PGHOST": "The host address or IP where your PostgreSQL database is running.",
  "PGPORT": "The port on which PostgreSQL is listening.",
  "PGDB": "The name of your PostgreSQL database."
}
```

4. Create virtual environment for Python
```bash
  python -m venv venv
```

5. Activate the enviroment
```bash
  source venv/bin/activate 
```

6. Install libreries
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7.  Create a `.env` file and add this variable:
   
    - WORK_PATH <- Sets the working directory for the application, indicating the base path for performing operations and¬†managing¬†files.
    - DAG_PATH <- Set the dag path, indicate the path of the dag folder
    - EMAIL <- Set your email address, this for the email that will send the notifications
      
9. __Create your database__, this step is opcional if you are running locally, but if you are in the cloud you must have already your database

10. Start with the notebooks:
- 001_grammy_awards.ipynb
- 002_spotify_dataset.ipynb

11. Start Airflow:
    
    - Export to airflow your current path
      ```bash
      export AIRFLOW_HOME=${pwd}
      ```
    - Run apache airflow
      ```bash
      airflow standalone
      ```
    - Then go to your browser a search 'localhost:8080'
   
    - Finally trigger the dag

This is how the dag should look like

12. Then go to Postgres and check if the table has been created successfully

13. Taking advantage of the database instance, go to Power Bi :  
13.1 Open a new dashboard

13.2 Look for 'Database PostgreSQL' :

13.3 Insert your information and accept :

13.4 Select the tables and load the data :

See my dashboard [here]() 

The data is now synchronized with power bi! You can do your own dashboard.
